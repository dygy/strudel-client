# Keyboard Shortcuts

Strudel includes several keyboard shortcuts to enhance your live coding experience. These shortcuts help you stay in the flow without interrupting your creative process.

## Essential Shortcuts

### Code Evaluation
- **Ctrl+Enter** (or **Cmd+Enter** on Mac): Evaluate and run your current pattern
- **Ctrl+U** (or **Cmd+U** on Mac): Update your pattern (alternative to Ctrl+Enter)

These are the most important shortcuts for live coding. Use them to quickly hear your code changes without reaching for the mouse.

### Playback Control
- **Ctrl+P** (or **Cmd+P** on Mac): Toggle play/pause

Start and stop your patterns instantly with this shortcut.

### File Management
- **Ctrl+S** (or **Cmd+S** on Mac): Save your current track (when logged in)

Quickly save your work to avoid losing your creative progress.

## Editor Shortcuts

### Comments
- **Cmd+/** (or **Ctrl+/** on Windows/Linux): Toggle line comments

Quickly comment or uncomment lines of code for experimentation.

### Editor Modes

Strudel supports different keybinding modes that you can configure in the Settings panel:

- **CodeMirror** (default): Standard text editor shortcuts
- **Vim**: Modal editing with Vim keybindings
- **Emacs**: Emacs-style shortcuts and commands
- **VSCode**: Visual Studio Code shortcuts

## Tips for Live Coding

1. **Learn the evaluation shortcuts first**: Ctrl+Enter and Ctrl+U are your most important tools
2. **Use Ctrl+P for quick stops**: When you need to silence everything quickly
3. **Save frequently**: Use Ctrl+S to save your progress regularly
4. **Experiment with comments**: Use Cmd+/ to quickly toggle parts of your code on and off

## Platform Differences

- **Mac**: Use **Cmd** instead of **Ctrl** for all shortcuts
- **Windows/Linux**: Use **Ctrl** for all shortcuts

The shortcuts are designed to work consistently across all platforms while respecting each platform's conventions.

## Customization

You can change the editor keybinding mode in the Settings panel to match your preferred editing style. This is especially useful if you're coming from Vim, Emacs, or VSCode and want familiar shortcuts.
